          <strong>Project:</strong> Python Escape Room
          <br>
          <strong>Class:</strong> Computer Science Principles

          <strong>Date:</strong> January 2020

          <strong>Partner:</strong> Ryan Strandberg
          <br>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> Create a text-based escape room game in Python.
          <br>
          <br>
          The goal of this project was to create an interactive Escape Room game with a central theme and multiple challenges for the player to solve. This was the first game I had ever created using Python, so writing the code for this game taught me a lot about what the language is capable of and helped me become more comfortable using functions. During this project, I worked mainly on writing the storyline and coming up with puzzles to give the player, while my partner created the flowchart. We then worked together to write all of the necessary functions. 
          <br> 
          <br>
          One of the main challenges we faced while creating this game was the limitations of it being completely text-based. Neither of us had ever made a text-based game before, so while brainstorming the story for our project, we had to think of ways to keep the player engaged without visual stimuli like images and animations that we were used to using in a game. This challenge pushed us to think outside of the box, which can be seen in our puzzle where we hid the answer in a paragraph of text by having only the letters that spelled out the secret code be in lowercase. Another challenge that we faced during this project was having to plan almost everything out before starting to code. Personally, when I have coded projects in the past, I start out with a solid foundation for the project and then continue to develop and improve it as I code. But because the storyline for the game was complex and intertwined, we had to figure out every single detail we wanted to include before starting the code. We did this using a flowchart and it ended up helping the rest of our project go a lot smoother, so I will be definitely using this approach for some of my projects in the future.

          <strong>Project:</strong> Space Invaders
          <br>
          <strong>Class:</strong> Computer Science Principles
          <br>
          <strong>Date:</strong> October 2019
          <br>
          <strong>Partner:</strong> Anish Senthil
          <br>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> Create a working Android game in MIT App Inventor.
          <br>
          <br>
          This was my first time using MIT App Inventor and my partner, Anish Senthil, and I were tasked with completing and improving a game tutorial. Our goal was to create a space invaders game that gets progressively harder as the user advances by increasing the speed of the sprites. At first we wanted to make a story to go along with the game, but because neither of us had used MIT App Inventor before, we decided that a full story would be outside of our time frame. Instead, we included a few introduction screens before the gameplay screen to make it more visually appealing. This ended up working out well, as we got a lot of positive feedback on this part of the game. 
          <br> 
          <br>
          For both my partner and I, this was the second coding program we had ever used, so it taught us a lot about using block commands to perform actions. One of the main challenges we faced while creating this game was being able to find the balance between making an entertaining and fun game without making it too hard for the user to play. In order to work around this, we tested the game multiple times with different speeds in an attempt to find what we liked best. The biggest things I learned from this project was that there is not always just one way to code something when programming and that I should always try to think outside of the box when I get stuck. This was my second time collaborating on a coding project with another person and I thought that we worked well together. Because of our varying intrests,we were able to bring different ideas to the table. For example, I am interested in design, so I worked on most of the images and documentation for the game, while Anish worked on the code more. Having this type dynamic required us to communicate effectively and work together in order to produce a successful project.
