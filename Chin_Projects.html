          <strong>Project:</strong> Space Invaders
          <br>
          <strong>Class:</strong> Computer Science Principles
          <br>
          <strong>Date:</strong> October 2019
          <br>
          <strong>Objective:</strong> Create a working Android game in MIT App Inventor.
          <br>
          <br>
          This was my first time using MIT App Inventor and my partner, Anish Senthil, and I were tasked with completing and improving a game tutorial. Our goal was to create a space invaders game that gets progressively harder as the user advances by increasing the speed of the sprites. At first we wanted to make a story to go along with the game, but because neither of us had used MIT App Inventor before, we decided that a full story would be outside of our time frame. Instead, we included a few introduction screens before the gameplay screen to make it more visually appealing. This ended up working out well, as we got a lot of positive feedback on this part of the game. 
          <br> 
          <br>
          For both my partner and I, this was the second coding program we had ever used, so it taught us a lot about using block commands to perform actions. One of the main challenges we faced while creating this game was being able to find the balance between making an entertaining and fun game without making it too hard for the user to play. In order to work around this, we tested the game multiple times with different speeds in an attempt to find what we liked best. The biggest things I learned from this project was that there is not always just one way to code something when programming and that I should always try to think outside of the box when I get stuck. This was my second time collaborating on a coding project with another person and I thought that we worked well together. Because of our varying intrests,we were able to bring different ideas to the table. For example, I am interested in design, so I worked on most of the images and documentation for the game, while Anish worked on the code more. Having this type dynamic required us to communicate effectively and work together in order to produce a successful project.
