      <p>Hi, I’m Chloe!
        <br>
        <br>
          I am currently a senior attending Dublin High School with an interest in user interface design and computer science. I have always been passionate about art and design but I have recently developed a curiosity for programming. I have always wanted to go into a field that focused on creativity and taking the course “Computer Science Principles” has helped me realize that I can pursue this goal in a field other than fine arts. Although I am fairly new to programming, I hope to be able to combine it with love for design in the future, working either as a web developer or UI designer. This fall, I will be attending the University of San Francisco to major in Computer Science and minor in design.  
          <br>
          <br>
          During my freshman year, I started a club called Do It Yourself Club and have been the president of it ever since. Do It Yourself Club, or DIY for short, is an arts and crafts club where students have the opportunity to explore new art mediums while making friends. As the leader of this club for the past three and a half years, I have been pushed out of my comfort zone and have learned to appreciate the value teamwork and collaboration can add to an activity. Through my club, I have been able to show students the positive impact art can have on the world through hands-on projects. For example, one project that we have done was making and selling handmade bracelets to raise money for the Kind Campaign, which brings awareness to the negative and long lasting effects of girl-on-girl bullying. While maintaining a rigorous course load at school, I have always been eager to continue my learning outside of the classroom. Following my interest in design, I have been learning various art mediums online, such as linocutting, embroidery, screen printing, painting, calligraphy, and digital drawing.

          One of my favorites that I have learned so far is calligraphy and I have recently started doing commissions for wedding invitations, place cards, signs, and thank you cards. With this new job, I have learned what it takes to develop a dependable business. Another hobby that I have been self-learning is photography. I got my first DSLR in June of 2018 and I have brought it with me everywhere ever since then. Although I have not been doing photography for very long, many people have asked me to take portraits for them at events, and I have taken advantage of these opportunities to improve my skills. Along with taking photos for people, I have also taught myself how to use post-production software, such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.

          <strong>Update - April 2020:</strong> During the past month of quarantine, I've been taking the time to do things that I usually don't have very much time to do. I've been doing things like learning Dutch, painting, bullet journaling, embroidering, and baking to pass the time. Bullet journalling is one of the most helpful things in my life, especially during school when I need to organize and remember all of my tasks. So, recently I've been brainstorming ideas for an app with one of my family friends that will combine everything that we love about bullet journaling with the convenience of being able to have it in our phones. We want to make it an iOS app, so we are currently learning Swift on Codecademy together. My goal is to design and finish this app by August so it will be ready for me to use when I go to college this fall. 
          <br>

          Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me! If you have any questions or would like to know more, feel free to visit the rest of my site or my Contact Me page!
